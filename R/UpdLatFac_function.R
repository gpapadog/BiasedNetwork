#' Updating the model's latent factors
#' 
#' MCMC sampling of latent factors for either set of species.
#' 
#' @param latfac Current values of the latent factors to be updated. Matrix
#' with number of rows equal to the number of species and number of columns
#' equal to the number of factors.
#' @param latfac_others Current values of the latent factors fot the other set
#' of species, not to be updated. Matrix. Rows correspond to species and
#' columns correspond to latent factors.
#' @param probobs Vector including the values for the probability of observing
#' a given species interaction within a study. Should be of length equal to the
#' number of species among this set.
#' @param coefs_probobs Coefficients of the latent factors for the normal model
#' on the logit of probability of observing a given species. If these
#' coefficients are all NA, then this implies that no bias correction for
#' geographical and taxonomical bias is performed, so this part of the model
#' does not inform the updates of the latent factors. Should be of length equal
#' to the number of latent factors used plus 1 for the intercept.
#' @param var_probobs Numeric. Variance in the model for the probability of
#' detecting an interaction. Used only if performing bias correction.
#' @param obs_covs  Matrix of observed traits. Rows correspond to species and
#' columns correspond to covariates. Continuous covariates should be included
#' first.
#' @param omega_obs_covs The Polya-Gamma omegas from the models of binary
#' covariates. Matrix. Rows correspond to units, columns to binary traits.
#' @param num_covs Vector of length 2 including the number of continuous and
#' binary traits.
#' @param coefs_covs Matrix of latent factor coefficients in the traits models.
#' Rows correspond to traits and columns to factors.
#' @param var_covs Vector of length equal to the number of continuous traits
#' including the residual variance of the corresponding model.
#' @param curr_inter Matrix with rows corresponding to the set of species whose
#' latent factors we are updating and columns corresponding to the other set of
#' species. Entries are 0 or 1.
#' @param coefs_inter Vector including the coefficients in the network model.
#' @param omega_inter The omegas generated from the Polya-Gamma for the model
#' of the true interactions L. The rows should correspond to the units whose
#' latent factors are updated using this function.
#' @param prior_S_inv The inverse of the current correlation matrix for the
#' latent factors that are being updated.
#' @param cut_feed Logical. Whether we should cut the feedback from the
#' interaction and detectability submodels into the latent factors. Defaults to
#' FALSE, in which case the full posterior is considered.
